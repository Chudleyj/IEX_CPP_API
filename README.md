# IEX_CPP_API
Unofficial C++ Lib for the IEXtrading API 

For the OFFICIAL API and its docs and  all credit to the data pulled by this program go to: https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/

This lib will allow for easier use of IEXtrading GET requests in C++ through the use of prebuilt functions. 

As it stands currently, the dependancies used in this lib will need to be manually installed:

Libcurl: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/install.html

Jsoncpp: https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

**NOTE:**

The code currently in "int main()" is simply test cases as this is still in dev. The final product would not use an "int main()", it just shows examples of how to use each function currently in the lib. 

**Using the lib:**

Formal docs to be added when this project gets closer to done, however some basic examples plus the offical docs should make this easy to use. See the int main() code for examples on using each currently supported function. Each function returns a JSON data type. This lib uses the Jsoncpp API for its' JSON data types. See the Jsoncpp docs linked above for info on how to use the JSON objects.
